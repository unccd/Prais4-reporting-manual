# 5. Strategic objective 5: To mobilize substantial and additional financial and non-financial resources to support the implementation of the Convention by building effective partnerships at global and national level

## Introduction

The strategic objective (SO) 5 indicator framework aims to enable Parties to report quantitative and qualitative information on financial and non-financial resources dedicated to supporting the implementation of the Convention. The set of indicators aims at comprehensive reporting.

This section of the manual addresses the issues related to the identification of resources specific to desertification/land degradation and drought (DLDD) and the structure of the indicator framework. It also explains the Tier approach used.

Identification of resources specific to DLDD or tracking resources for the implementation of the Convention concerns accounting for (i) the financial and non-financial resources employed by activities that avoid, reduce, and reverse the effects of land degradation and desertification; and (ii) the preparedness for, mitigation of and response to drought at different scales. The most relevant challenge lies in the identification of DLDD-specific resources among a range of those allocated for other purposes.

This section of the user manual does not provide a prescriptive definition of which activities can be accounted for as being DLDD-relevant, nor does it exclude any; however, it includes activities, examples, and options as well as a non-exhaustive list of DLDD activities, which might be useful references for the identification of relevant activities. It is up to the reporting Party to provide insights on how those activities are chosen as relevant and explain the methodology used.

### Structure and aim of the SO 5 indicator framework

The indicator framework considers the current reporting experiences under the other Rio conventions. It has been revised taking into account the measurement, reporting and verification system under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (with its current Biennial Update Reports), the National Communications templates, and the most recent updates regarding the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement and the financial reporting framework under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), with the aim of increasing synergies in data collection and reporting.

### Tier approach for SO 5

The SO 5 indicator framework offers flexibility by introducing Tiers, facilitating the reporting for those Parties that lack quantitative and/or detailed data.

Tier 1 reporting includes descriptive and qualitative information relevant to the indicator, as well as information on trends. Descriptions can include quantitative information at a level of detail which is too low to be reported in the Tier 2 tabular format. It should also include all information that cannot be reported in tabular format, such as descriptions of projects, programmes, instruments, and policies, as well as case studies, experiences, and best practices.

Tier 2 reporting is additional to Tier 1 reporting and provides a tabular format to be filled in along 16 parameters included in the columns. Tier 2 aims to collect more detailed quantitative and descriptive information at the highest disaggregation level available. The table should be complemented by information on definitions and methodologies used for the relevant parameters to be included in the documentation box. Relevant resources and databases should be included in each indicator, providing references for data sources, definitions, and methodologies in support of the reporting.

## 5.1. SO 5-1 – Bilateral and multilateral public resources

### 5.1.1. Introduction

This indicator aims to capture information on international resources provided and received through bilateral and multilateral channels. The indicator envisages reporting of information on the trends over the four -year period (Tier 1) and additional quantitative data at disaggregated level in tabular format (Tier 2). Default data will be provided based on the desertification Rio Marker of the OECD, when available[^1].

[^1]: For methodological information see Methodological Note.

### 5.1.2. Prerequisites for reporting

Institutional arrangements to collect data on international financial and non-financial resources provided and received through bilateral and multilateral channels for the implementation of the Convention. Data on international support provided to and received by third countries are often collected by a country’s ministry of foreign affairs, development agencies or national statistical offices. Countries reporting according to the OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS) count on a relevant source of data. If information on the relevance of resources provided and received specific for DLDD is not available, the country is encouraged to set up relevant institutional arrangements to start collecting this information.

### 5.1.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

If the default data is used, Parties are encouraged to verify the information and amend as necessary, or complement the default data with additional information. Further rows can be added.

The reporting steps are described in the following sections.

#### Step 1: Identification of relevant data

If your country is both a provider and a recipient of international public bilateral and/or multilateral resources, you are encouraged to provide information on both.

##### Flows

To report against the SO 5-1 indicator, Parties should look at official public flows from international sources. This category tracks primarily resource flows between countries in the form of ‘official development assistance’ (ODA) and ‘other official flows’ (OOF). Both providers and recipients of international public support draw upon the OECD DAC system as a dataset that can be consulted from both the provider and recipient perspectives.

Official transactions are those undertaken by central, state, or local government agencies at their own risk and responsibility. In case an activity or project is funded by different sources of funding – for example, through both public and private resources – it is recommended to report the amount of public resources under the SO 5-1 indicator and the amount of private resources under the SO 5-3 indicator. This would lead to double reporting (the Party would replicate some information related to the relevant project in two separate tables) but would avoid the double-counting of amounts.

````{admonition} Examples

class: font-style-italic
---
For providers: 

- Public financial contributions provided to developing countries’ governments and implementing agencies.
- Quantified in-kind contributions provided to projects in developing countries.
- Public financial resources for technical assistance.
- Support to projects including a component of technology development and transfer in developing countries.
- Contributions to United Nations agencies. 

For recipients: 

- International financial contributions received by central or local governments and implementing agencies.
- Financial contributions received from third countries’ governments or multilateral organizations, funds, or United Nations agencies.

##### Relevance to desertification/land degradation and drought

The OECD DAC CRS collects activity-level data on activities targeting the environmental objectives of the three Rio conventions (CBD, UNCCD and UNFCCC) through Rio Markers for biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation and desertification. This category can be measured using the Rio Marker for Desertification marker to report on ODA and, where available, on OOF. The OECD Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD) dataset include information on support provided by developing countries. Relevant activities can be identified through SDG field (SDG 15.3).

The methodology used to identify DLDD-relevant activities and the classification method used should be clearly explained in the narrative parts of the indicator’s framework and/or in the documentation boxes.

#### Step 2: Estimate trends in bilateral and multilateral public resources

Tier 1 involves reporting trends in the progress indicator in qualitative terms (increasing, stable or declining trends) based on the expert opinion of the reporting Party. Choose the option representing the trend in the international public resources provided and received during the four-year period for activities relevant to the implementation of the Convention in the relevant table. Indicate the general trend within that period, for both tables if your country is both a provider and a recipient. Otherwise, indicate the trend for either one. Select only one option for each table.

#### Step 3:  Reporting in narrative format

SO5-1 requests descriptive and qualitative information relevant to the international public resources provided and received through bilateral and multilateral channels. The descriptive section may include all information that cannot be reported in tabular format and provide general information on resources provided and received for the implementation of the Convention.

````{admonition} Examples
---
class: font-style-italic
---
International resources provided: […The countries where most projects under the Convention are carried out are Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal, and the United Republic of Tanzania.]

International resources received: Trinational project ‘Sustainable Forest Management in the Transboundary Gran Chaco American Ecosystem (Global Environment Facility (GEF)–Gran Chaco)’ – Project ID 2505 GEF of GEF-4 – has a GEF grant of USD 2,663,018 for Argentina, plus 60 % of the regional cost of USD 1,290,909 (approximately USD 774,545).….]

````

#### Step 4:  Compiling the table

Tier 2 involves reporting trends in the progress indicators in a quantitative manner. Under this Tier, country Parties are encouraged to report by recording data about individual projects specific to DLDD. Please compile the table with data at the highest level of disaggregation available. Parties are encouraged to provide activity-level data.

Default data are derived from information reported to the OECD DAC by OECD members based on the desertification Rio Marker[^2];  default data can be amended by the reporting Party as appropriate.

Tier 2 reporting includes:

- Detailed information at projects programmes and/or countries/regions, including amounts.

- Aggregate amounts of resources provided and/or received, by year and/or over the four-year period.

[^2]: Default data are included in each provider and recipient country tables. Reported activities are identified based on the OECD DAC Rio Marker for desertification. All activities marked with the marker ‘principal’ and ‘significant’ are included in the tables, and respective amounts are reported at 100 %.

##### Parameters

The table for SO 5-1 provides space to report activities or projects relevant to combating DLDD. While the methodological approach to be chosen by the reporting Party accommodates definitions and methodologies in use, the reporting manual suggests some approaches and definitions for each parameter.

- Provided/received: Indicate ‘provided’ if, for the reported activity, the reporting country is the provider of the resources; indicate ‘received’ if your country is the recipient of the resources.

- Year: Indicate the year relevant to the reported activity. Explain in the documentation box whether the year refers to the commitment or disbursement year, and if the fiscal or calendar year is used.

- Recipient/provider: Indicate the name of the recipient if the reporting country is the provider of resources; indicate the name of the provider if your country is the recipient of resources. This could include the name of the country or the region; be listed as ‘global’ (bilateral flows); or include the name of the institution and/or entity (multilateral flows).

- Title of project, programme, activity or other: In cases of contributions to multilateral development banks/multilateral funds or participation in replenishments of funds, etc.

- Total amount in USD: The amounts should be reported in USD; if the reporting country decides otherwise, the approach should be explained clearly in the methodology. This implies the application of an exchange rate to the different domestic currencies. The OECD DAC CRS includes amounts in thousands of USD. The World Bank annual average exchange rate is suggested; please indicate if (and how) a different exchange rate is used. It is possible to report both amounts committed and disbursed for each activity. Committed and disbursed figures cannot be summed up; all reporting shall avoid double-counting across years. From the recipient perspective, the column “committed” can remain empty.

- Sector: Four macro sectors are suggested in the table. Crosscutting refers to activities that are addressed to more than one sector. The reporting country has the possibility to indicate other sectors, accommodating possible different reporting standards and practices. The indication of ‘other’ is optional; only the name of the sector is to be included.

- Capacity-building: For each activity and to the extent possible, please indicate whether it includes a capacity-building component; if the activity aims, among other things, to build the capacities of the recipient country; and/or if at least part of the budget of the project has been dedicated to capacity-building to address DLDD.

- Technology transfer: For each activity and to the extent possible, please indicate whether it includes a technology transfer component; if the activity aims to transfer and develop technologies in the recipient country; and/or if at least part of the budget has been dedicated to transferring technologies to address DLDD.

- Gender equality: For each activity and to the extent possible, indicate whether it targets gender equality. The OECD DAC CRS system includes a gender equality policy marker, which could be a useful indicator to compile this column, as available.

- Channel: Please indicate whether the amounts to be considered are bilateral (country to country), multi-bilateral (a multilateral entity managing a project on behalf of a country providing earmarked funds for that activity), or multilateral. Type of flow: Indicate whether the flow is ODA or OOF. Other categories should be included if a different classification method is employed.

- Financial instrument: Please indicate the financial instrument channelling the public resources reported.

- Type of support: Indicate whether the activity is directly or indirectly related to the objectives of the Convention. Reporting this information could be based on the use of principal and significant Rio Markers as in the OECD DAC CRS system, where available.

- Amount mobilized through public interventions: Indicator SO 5-1 provides the space to include information on amounts mobilized from the private sector by official development finance interventions. In this regard, the OECD DAC offers an instrument-specific approach covering all private finance leveraged by public interventions with a direct causality link between flows. A dedicated column in the proposed tabular format is added to facilitate harmonization with the OECD DAC CRS reporting.

- Use, impact, (estimated) results: The table provides the space to include additional project-level information about the use of resources, the impact with respect to the objectives of the Convention, and results (estimated if the project did not conclude before the end of the reporting period).

- Additional information: please include any other activity-level information that you deem relevant.

\* If disaggregated information is not available, the Party can report only the total amount or the total amounts per year.

##### Aggregating the information

The aggregation of figures should include all quantified resources reported in tabular format. It is possible to aggregate figures by status (committed and disbursed) and by year. It is recommended to then aggregate figures for the four-year period to generate a total figure for international resources.  

Aggregation of figures must avoid double-counting across the table and the other indicators.

#### Step 5: Use of documentation box

The aim of the documentation box is to provide space to report necessary definitions and methodologies employed for each parameter compiled in the table and included in the description, as relevant. When an internationally agreed standard is used, it is possible to provide the relevant reference.

## 5.2. SO5-2 – Domestic public resources

### 5.2.1. Introduction

Domestic resources are at the core of the implementation of the Convention. This indicator aims at creating an overview of the resources available at national level by measuring the effort that the national public sector is undertaking in increasing resources for the implementation of the Convention.

This progress indicator is concerned with domestic resources mobilized and spent by government agencies at different levels (e.g., central, state, and local governments) on activities, projects, policies, and measures to pursue the objectives of the Convention.

The indicator also aims to collect information on public revenues, such as environmental taxes on land-degrading activities and resources collected through mechanisms to influence the behavior of the various entities in the economy regarding DLDD (i.e., incentives).

Reporting countries can choose to take advantage of the Tier approach, in line with the capacities and data availability in the reporting country. It will be possible to compile only Tier 1 (including the narrative description and the indication of trends) or both Tier 1 and Tier 2 (including the compilation of the table with more detailed quantitative data).  

Tier 1 involves reporting trends in this progress indicator in qualitative terms (i.e., increasing, stable or declining trends).  
Tier 2 aims to collect information at the highest disaggregation level available. Countries are encouraged to report using Tier 2.

### 5.2.2. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

#### Step 1: Identification of relevant data

Data relevant to this indicator are usually collected at central government level, often from the ministries of economy and finance, ministries of environment and ministries of agriculture and forestry, as well as Environmental Agencies.

Government budgets do not often include clear information on resources specific to land degradation. Moreover, resources indirectly allocated to activities that promote land rehabilitation could be integrated in sectoral policies. Thus, an inventory approach could be taken in accordance with the agreed definition of DLDD. More broadly, further insights on relevant measures and actions are provided by the Convention, in particular Articles 10.3 and 10.4. Significant international references are the UN SEEA, the CEPA classification system and the IMF GFS database.

The indicator also aims at collecting information on domestic public revenues collected through measures and actions aimed at incentivizing behavior consistent with combating land degradation. Those may include environment-related tax revenues on natural resources, environmental taxes etc.

The reference data sources are central government administrations and national statistical offices. A significant international reference data source is the OECD Policy Instruments for the Environment database[^3].

[^3]: The database is freely accessible at www.oecd.org/env/policies/database

#### Step 2: Estimate trends in domestic public resources

Tier 1 involves reporting trends in the progress indicator in qualitative terms (i.e., increasing, stable or declining trends) based on the expert opinion of the reporting Party. Choose the option representing the trend for the entire reporting period in the relevant table. Indicate the trend in both tables if your country provides information on both expenditures and revenues. Otherwise, indicate the trend for either one. Select only one option for each table.

#### Step 3: Reporting in narrative format

The aim of this section is to provide Parties the space to report on information on the context and complement the reporting against Tier 1 (trends) or Tier 2 (table).

````{admonition} Examples
---
class: font-style-italic
---
- “Public expenditures related to sustainable agriculture in year 2018 increased to USD 168 million.” 
- “National resources allocated to protection and ecosystem restoration are mainly channeled through the Ministry of Agriculture.”
- “The budget allocation of the National Directorate for Planning and Environmental Land Management, which carries out the NAP, is included in the National Budget Programme No. 60 for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014.
- “Data was retrieved directly from published sources of federal, provincial and territorial governments; official data was retrieved from the statistical office.”
````

#### Step 4:  Compiling the table

Tier 2 involves reporting against the progress indicators in a quantitative manner. Parties are encouraged to provide data on individual policies, measures or activities combating DLDD, as well as government budgetary lines and programmes. In this sense, it is recommended to use a bottom-up, inventory approach for collecting data on DLDD-related projects, programmes, measures, or budget lines supported by domestic public resources.

##### Parameters

The table for SO 5-2 provides space to report those actions that are considered relevant to combating DLDD. The reporting Party can choose the methodology to accommodate definitions and approaches in use, but the reporting manual suggests some approaches and definitions for each parameter.

- Year: Indicate the year relevant to the reported activity. Explain in the documentation box whether the year refers to the commitment or disbursement year, and if the fiscal or calendar year is used. It is possible to indicate the timeframe rather than a specific year, but this should fall within the reporting period.

- Amount in USD: The amounts should be reported in USD. If the reporting country decides otherwise, the approach should be explained clearly in the methodology. This implies the application of an exchange rate to the respective domestic currencies. The World Bank annual average exchange rate is suggested; please indicate if (and how) a different exchange rate is used.
- Additional information: Please include any other activity-level information that you deem relevant, including the title of the measure, budget lines or activity funded.

```

\*\* The private contribution to this PPP is reported under SO 5-3.

##### Aggregating the information

A total figure for **government expenditures, including subsidies and other transfers**, will be computed automatically. Thus, avoiding any double counting between these categories is recommended.  A separate total figure for **government revenues and other transfers** will be automatically calculated. Subtotal figures by year are also envisaged for this reporting table.

#### Step 5: Use of documentation box

The aim of the documentation box is to provide space to report the necessary definitions and methodologies employed for each relevant parameter included in the table and the description, as relevant. When an international agreed standard is used, it is possible to provide the relevant reference.

#### Step 6: Qualitative question

The reporting Party is invited to share information on whether it set a **target for domestic resource mobilization**. If yes, provide further details on the features of this target, the timing, and the progress monitoring process.

## 5.3. SO5-3 – International and domestic private resources

### 5.3.1. Introduction

The indicator aims at monitoring private resources mobilized by the private sector of the reporting Party for activities and investments ‘at home’ (domestic) and in third countries (international). The scope of this indicator encompasses financing by all private sector organizations including corporations (e.g., private sector funds), households and non-profit organizations (e.g., philanthropic foundations) from domestic and international sources. Such private sources of financing provide resources in the form of concessional and non-concessional resources to implement the Convention.  

The indicator allows for reporting on innovative sources of finance and the number of co-financing partners, for those related to the private sector. Further information related to co-financing and innovative sources of finance in the public sector could be reported under the previous two indicators.

The reporting country should select the most relevant Tier approach based on the capacities and data available.

### 5.3.2. Prerequisites for reporting

- Institutional arrangements in place for the collection of financial data on private resources allocated to combat DLDD.  

- Capacity to access commercial databases to analyse private sector reports and dedicated case studies.

- Mechanisms to involve private actors in the compilation of the information.

### 5.3.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

The UNCCD offers the option to report on SO 5-3 both in qualitative and quantitative terms, subject to data availability. No default data will be provided against this indicator.

#### Step 1: Identification of relevant data

Data relevant to this indicator are usually collected at central government level (in turn also from local authorities). Parties are encouraged to make their best efforts to provide information at the highest disaggregation level available. **Relevance to desertification/land degradation and drought**

The relevance of funded activities, projects or investments of the private sector should be consistent with the DLDD-relevance criteria employed to report against the other indicators for monitoring domestic and international resource flows.

##### Flows

OECD statistics on development finance (from the CRS) include activity-level data on funds from around 40 of the largest philanthropic foundations, many of which provide finance for environmental objectives[^4].  The OECD statistics on the amounts mobilized from the private sector also provide insights on international private sector contributions for development, including for SDG 14 and 15[^5].  

[^4]: See <https://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/beyond-oda-foundations.htm>.
[^5]: See <https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/mobilisation.htm>.

#### Step 2: Estimate trends in international and domestic private resources

Tier 1 involves reporting trends in the progress indicator in qualitative terms (i.e., increasing, stable or declining trends) based on the expert opinion of the reporting Party. Choose the option representing the trend in the international private resources and domestic private resources for activities relevant to the implementation of the Convention in the relevant table for the four-year period. Select only one option for each table.

#### Step 3: Reporting in narrative format

SO5-3 requests the provision of relevant descriptive and qualitative information. The aim of this section is to provide Parties the space to report on information on the context and complement the reporting against Tier 1 (trends) or Tier 2 (table).

````{admonition} Examples
---
class: font-style-italic
---
“The reporting country undertook important public–private partnerships with [the recipient country] and [the third country’s] private companies. These have been mobilizing XY euros to pursue…”

“Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are funded at 80% by public sources and they need to co-finance 20% of each project/programme (own contribution). This means that besides the development cooperation budget, the NGOs are the most important co-financing partners for activities relevant to the implementation of the Convention. These contributions come from the private sector, private donations, other donors and the European Union.”
````

#### Step 4: Compiling the table

##### Parameters

The table for SO 5-3 provides space to report at project level (or at the highest level of disaggregation available) on actions, investments or programmes that are considered relevant to combating desertification. The reporting Party can choose the methodology to accommodate definitions in use, but the reporting manual suggests some approaches for each parameter. Reporting countries are encouraged to clearly explain the definitions used.

- Year: Indicate the year relevant to the reported activity. Explain whether the fiscal or calendar year is used.

- Title of project, programme, activity or other: This field includes the title of the project or activity, as well as the type of investment and initiative.

- Total amount in USD: The amounts should be reported in USD; if the reporting country decides otherwise, the approach should be explained clearly in the methodology. This implies the application of an exchange rate to the different domestic currencies. The World Bank annual average exchange rate is suggested; please indicate if (and how) a different exchange rate is used.

- Financial instrument: Please indicate the financial instrument channelling the private resources reported.

- Type of institution:  Indicate which private entity is extending the resources relevant to DLDD.

- Recipient/domestic: Indicate the recipient’s name if the reporting country’s private sector contribution is addressed to a recipient third country; indicate ‘domestic’ if the private sector of the reporting country provides contributions to activities in the reporting country itself.

- Additional information: Please include any other activity-level information that you deem relevant, including the name of the private sector entity, details on the recipient and the description of the activity.

** The public contribution to the PPP is reported under SO 5-2.

##### Aggregating the information

Figures will be aggregated as totals by geography (one figure for domestic private resources, one figure for international private resources) and subtotals per year.  Aggregation by financial instrument could also be meaningful information to gather, considering the wide range of instruments and their role within the DLDD financing landscape at domestic and international level.

Aggregation of figures must avoid double-counting across the table and the other indicators.

#### Step 5: Reporting methodological information

Unlike indicators SO 5-1 and SO 5-2 (which include a documentation box), the SO 5-3 indicator includes a separate question for the methodological information. This different approach leaves further flexibility for reporting countries regarding the requisite information and how to structure and elaborate on it, considering that reporting on domestic and international private resources may vary significantly from country to country.

## 5.4. SO5-4 – Technology transfer

### 5.4.1. Introduction

The Convention explicitly requires Parties to promote, finance and facilitate the financing of the transfer, acquisition, adaptation and development of environmentally sound, economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and/or mitigating the effects of drought; and encourages the facilitation of technology cooperation among affected country Parties through financial assistance or other appropriate means, and through international cooperation (Article 20).

This indicator aims at collecting information from Parties on resources allocated to the transfer of technologies to implement the Convention, both provided to and received from other countries. Moreover, it provides the space to report on technology transfer requirements, both in a qualitative and quantitative manner.

### 5.4.2. Prerequisites for reporting

- Access to databases which allow for the identification of DLDD-related projects or activities that include a technology transfer component.

- Capacity to undertake an inventory or a case-by-case approach if available data do identify technology transfer projects that address DLDD.

- Capacity to select the most significant projects and activities focusing on technology transfer or including a technology transfer component and provide information on those selected projects.

### 5.4.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

The UNCCD offers the option to report on SO 5-4 both in qualitative and quantitative terms, subject to data availability. No default data will be provided against this indicator.

#### Step 1: Identification of relevant data

There is currently no defined methodology for identifying DLDD-relevant activities that include a technology transfer component or are specifically aimed at transferring or developing technologies to combat DLDD; however, the template may accommodate different approaches.

The suggested approach is to draw upon the OECD DAC CRS database for ODA flows, OOF, and Private development finance and the Rio Marker for desertification, and select projects specifically aimed at transferring or developing technologies to combat DLDD or with a relevant component. It is possible to consider resources extended to teaching institutions, research institutes and similar agencies. There are potential interlinkages with projects dealing with technologies for climate adaptation, for which taxonomies and classifications are available[^6],  which could serve as a reference for the identification of relevant technologies.

#### Step 2: Estimate trends in technology transfer resources provided and received

Choose the option representing the trend in the international resources provided and received for technology transfer activities for the implementation of the Convention in the relevant table for the four-year period. Indicate the general trend within this period, for both tables if your country is both a provider and a recipient. Otherwise, indicate the trend for either one. Select only one option for each table.

#### Step 3: Reporting in narrative format

The aim of this section is to provide Parties the space to report information on context and complement the reporting against Tier 1 (trends) or Tier 2 (table).

The description may include:

- Strategies employed to support technology development and transfer, including case studies.

- Support for the development and enhancement of in-country capacities and technologies.

- Resources provided, received, and required for the use and dissemination of modern technology for the collection, transmission, and assessment of data on land degradation.

- Measures to facilitate the adaptation of technology, knowledge, know-how and practices to wide use and integration with modern technology.

- How Parties cooperate internationally in the fields of technology transfer as well as scientific research and development.

- Efforts to encourage private sector activities related to technology development and transfer and how such efforts support developing country Parties.

#### Step 4: Compiling the table

Under Tier 2, country Parties are encouraged to report by recording data about individual projects aimed at transferring technologies to combat DLDD. The table is to be compiled either seeking to provide a complete picture on technology transfer activities; or with selected projects and measures for which more detailed information is available. In fact, it is possible to use the SO 5-1 technology transfer parameter to aggregate total amounts related to technology transfer. Reporting countries should clearly explain the approach to the compilation of the table, and with respect to the use of the SO 5-1 parameter.

##### Parameters

The reporting Party can choose the methodology to accommodate definitions is use, but the reporting manual suggests some approaches for each parameter included in the table.

- Provided/received/required: Indicate ‘provided’ if for the reported activity the reporting country is the provider of the technology transferred; indicate ‘received’ if the reporting country is the recipient of the technology transferred; indicate ‘required’ if the reported activity is the technology transferred required by the reporting country.

- Year: Indicate the year relevant to the reported activity. Explain whether fiscal or calendar year is used. It is possible to indicate a timeframe rather than a specific year if it falls within the reporting period.

- Title of project, programme, activity or other.

- Total amount in USD: The amounts should be reported in USD. If the reporting country decides otherwise, the approach should be explained clearly in the methodology. This implies the application of an exchange rate to the different domestic currencies. The World Bank annual average exchange rate is suggested; please indicate if (and how) a different exchange rate is used. It is possible to report on either amount committed or disbursed; the approach used should be explained and double counting should be avoided.

- Recipient/provider: Indicate the name of the recipient if your country is the provider of resources; indicate the name of provider if your country is the recipient of resources. It could include the name of the country/region or be listed as ‘global’ (bilateral flows); or include the name of the institution and/or entity (multi-bilateral flows). If information on domestic transfer of technologies is included, indicate ‘domestic’ and provide further information on the providers and recipients of resources in the initiative.

- Description and objectives: Include information on the objective of the technology transferred in the new context.

- Sector: Indicate the sector according to the classification system used in other indicators.

- Type of technology: Indicate the technology/ies being transferred. Explain the definition and categorization used for DLDD-relevant technologies in the methodological information.

- Activities undertaken by the private sector, public sector of both.

- Status of measure of activity: Indicate whether the activity is planned, ongoing or completed at the time of the last reporting year.

- Timeframe of measure or activity: It is possible to indicate the timeframe covered by the implementation of the project, or the year of commitment or disbursement of amounts.

- Use, impact and (estimated) results: include additional project-level information about the use of resources, the impact with respect to the objectives of the Convention, and results (estimated if the project did not conclude before the end of the reporting period).

- Additional information: Please include any other activity-level information that you deem relevant, including, for example, information on co-financing arrangements and the respective role of the public and/or private sector.

#### Step 5: Reporting methodological information

The SO 5-4 indicator includes a separate question for the methodological information, providing the space to report any relevant approaches and definition used in the reporting.

## 5.5. SO5-5 – Future support for activities related to the implementation of the Convention

### 5.5.1. Introduction

SO5-5 is a qualitative indicator with three questions that encourage country Parties to reflect on future resources to be targeted at implementing the Convention.

In particular, the indicator allows country Parties to provide descriptive information on planned domestic resources, both public and private. It also provides a space to report on the planned provision and mobilization of international public and private resources. The third question aims to facilitate sharing of information on resources needed by Parties for the implementation of the Convention.

### 5.5.2. Prerequisites for reporting

- Access to provisional budgets of central administrations for both domestic and international resource allocation, and the capacity to distinguish DLDD-related funds.

- Adoption of a consistent and clear methodology to estimate the quantitative amounts of resources needed to implement the Convention.

### 5.5.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

The indicator offers the option to report on three different aspects of future support through SO 5-5 in qualitative terms. No default data will be provided against this indicator.

At national level, information can be found in the relevant sections of public provisional budgets, as well as in environment-related financial pledges and planned policies and measures related to DLDD. It is possible to use a case-by-case approach for the domestic private sector, as well as available data from research, case studies and dedicated datasets.

### SO5-5.1: Planned provision and mobilization of domestic public and private resources

````{admonition} Examples
---
class: font-style-italic
---
- “The reporting country will continue to provide public support to address land degradation and drought to developing countries and affected country Parties through bilateral and multilateral channels for rehabilitation and soil improvement, combating soil erosion and desertification, and sustainable agriculture.”

- “The national system allows for the tracking of future resources aimed at pursuing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15, thanks to the recently established strategic committee on SDG implementation in partner countries, managed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thus, the estimated amounts reported will be dedicated to the achievement of SDG 15.”

class: font-style-italic
---
- “In the reporting county, a programme on improving food security and enhancing farmers’ initiatives is being implemented. It is aimed at sustainably increasing production and fostering jobs for women and youth by adopting resilient agro-farming practices, restoring degraded lands, and improving natural resources management. A budget of USD 15 million (XYZ domestic currency) has been allocated to this measure for the triennium 2021–2023.”

- “The central government budget line dedicated to sustainable land management (see SO 5-2) for the years 2022–2024 is endowed with USD 14 million across the triennium. In accordance with the recently adopted “Programming document for national land management”, this budget line will likely be entirely dedicated to activities pursuing the implementation of strategic objectives included in the aforementioned programming document 
````

### SO5-5.3: Resources needed

````{admonition} Examples
---
class: font-style-italic
---
- “Based on the results of the assessment conducted in 2019, the reporting country aims at developing a land degradation neutrality (LDN) targets implementation plan. The most promising and feasible measures will be identified, as well as related budget, capacity-building and technology transfer needs.” 

- “Regions in the country most affected by DLDD are …. Those regions need significant investments to reduce vulnerabilities caused by land degradation. Following a case study survey among the local population, projects on the ground need to target local communities and indigenous peoples in sustainable land use with the aim of creating synergies with local practices and knowledge.”

- “The reported estimate of USD 16.96 million is based on a study conducted on the basis on the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) methodology, with further internal developments to adapt it to the objectives of the national LDN targets.
````

**Aggregating the information**

Aggregation of figures for this indicator is not envisaged. Aggregated figures could be included by reporting countries. In this case, reporting country should clearly explain how information is aggregated within the three sub-indicators. Figures across the three indicators cannot be aggregated, as different in nature and domain. Aggregation of figures must avoid double counting across years.
