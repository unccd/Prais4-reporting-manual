msgid "The world’s species are impacted by several threatening processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. On-ground land restoration actions under the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) can mitigate threatening processes and reduce species extinction risk. The Red List Index (RLI) can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species because of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated. The RLI is also Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.5.1[^1].  The RLI estimates trends in the overall extinction risk of sets of species to determine trends in biodiversity status. It is based on changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species[^2]."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SO4.md:13
msgid "The RLI value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as ‘Least Concern’) to 0 (all species are categorized as ‘Extinct’), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. Thus, the RLI allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level of extinction risk (i.e. how threatened they are on average) and in the rate at which this risk changes over time. A downward trend in the RLI over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is declining (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. Currently, the RLI is available for five taxonomic groups: birds, mammals, amphibians, cycads and warm-water reef-forming corals. It has also been aggregated into a single index for these five groups[^3]."
