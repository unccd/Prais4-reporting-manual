msgid ""
"Information reported by Parties under the Convention is used in several "
"ways. It is employed to monitor progress towards achieving SDG target "
"15.3 and to help guide policy formulation at the national and "
"international level to combat desertification/land degradation and "
"drought (DLDD). The information helps policymakers to better understand "
"the geographical areas that are most affected in their countries and "
"allows more targeted measures and interventions to be designed and "
"implemented. A number of countries have leveraged the data and "
"information provided in the latest round of reporting (2022) to produce "
"national action plans to address land degradation or used some of the "
"material as part of project proposals to seek national and international "
"funding to implement concrete actions on the ground. Comprehensive "
"reports by Parties provide practical demonstrations of how to optimise "
"the reporting and implement on the ground interventions while motivating "
"other Parties and build understanding of successes and challenges in "
"implementing the Convention. Finally, the reported information plays an "
"important role in raising awareness of the importance of sustainable land"
" management and advocating for land restoration initiatives that can help"
" combat DLDD and their impacts on populations. In a nutshell, national "
"reporting puts data and information on land to good use."
