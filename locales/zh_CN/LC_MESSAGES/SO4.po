"世界动植物物种受到多种威胁过程的影响，包括栖息地破坏和退化、过度开发、外来物种入侵、人类干扰、污染和气候变化。根据《联合国防治荒漠化公约》（UNCCD）开展的实地土地恢复行动可以缓解威胁过程，降低物种灭绝的风险。红色名录指数（RLI）可用于评估由于这些威胁而导致的物种灭绝风险的总体变化，以及威胁得到缓解的程度。红色名录指数也是可持续发展目标（SDG）指标15.5.1[^1]。"
"  RLI "
"可估算各组物种总体灭绝风险的趋势，以确定生物多样性状况的趋势。它基于《世界自然保护联盟（IUCN）濒危物种红色名录》[^2]中每一类灭绝风险物种数量的变化。"

"The RLI value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as ‘Least Concern’)"
" to 0 (all species are categorized as ‘Extinct’) and so indicates how far "
"the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. Thus, the RLI "
"allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level of "
"extinction risk (i.e. how threatened they are on average) and in the rate at"
" which this risk changes over time. A downward trend in the RLI over time "
"means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening "
"(i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means "
"that the expected rate of species extinctions is declining (i.e. the rate of"
" biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the "
"expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each"
" of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. "
"Currently, the RLI is available for five taxonomic groups: birds, mammals, "
"amphibians, cycads and warm-water reef-forming corals. It has also been "
"aggregated into a single index for these five groups[^3]."
msgstr ""
"RLI 值的范围从 1（所有物种都被归类为 \"最不受关注\"）到 0（所有物种都被归类为 "
"\"灭绝\"），因此表明了这组物种在整体上走向灭绝的程度。因此，利用 RLI "
"可以比较不同物种灭绝风险的总体水平（即物种平均受到威胁的程度）以及这种风险随时间变化的速度。随着时间的推移，RLI "
"呈下降趋势，这意味着未来物种灭绝的预期速率正在恶化（即生物多样性丧失的速率正在增加）。上升趋势意味着预期的物种灭绝率正在下降（即生物多样性丧失率正在降低），水平线意味着预期的物种灭绝率保持不变，但在上述每种情况下，这并不意味着生物多样性丧失已经停止。目前，RLI"
" 可用于五个分类群：鸟类、哺乳动物、两栖动物、苏铁类和暖水成礁珊瑚。该指数还被汇总为这五个类别的单一指数[^3]。"
