"On the other hand, income inequality is a useful alternative to the "

"which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption "
"expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates "
"from perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 represents perfect "
"equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality."
