"The world’s species are impacted by several threatening processes, "
"including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive"
" alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. On-"
"ground land restoration actions under the implementation of the United "
"Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) can mitigate "
"threatening processes and reduce species extinction risk. The Red List "
"Index (RLI) can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk "
"of groups of species because of these threats and the extent to which "
"threats are being mitigated. The RLI is also Sustainable Development Goal"
" (SDG) indicator 15.5.1[^1].  The RLI estimates trends in the overall "
"extinction risk of sets of species to determine trends in biodiversity "
"status. It is based on changes in the number of species in each category "
"of extinction risk on the International Union for Conservation of Nature "
"(IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species[^2]."

"The RLI value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as ‘Least "
"Concern’) to 0 (all species are categorized as ‘Extinct’), and so "
"indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards "
"extinction. Thus, the RLI allows comparisons between sets of species in "
"both their overall level of extinction risk (i.e. how threatened they are"
" on average) and in the rate at which this risk changes over time. A "
"downward trend in the RLI over time means that the expected rate of "
"future species extinctions is worsening (i.e. the rate of biodiversity "
"loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of "
"species extinctions is declining (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is "
"decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of "
"species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these "
"cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. Currently, the"
" RLI is available for five taxonomic groups: birds, mammals, amphibians, "
"cycads and warm-water reef-forming corals. It has also been aggregated "
"into a single index for these five groups[^3]."
