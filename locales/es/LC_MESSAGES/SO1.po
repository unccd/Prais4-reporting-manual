Information about the location of the sites, the areal extent of the site (auto-filled by the PRAIS 4 spatial data viewer, if used), the processes behind the false positive/false negative outcome and the basis for their judgement should be  reported in addition to the period when the false negative or false positive process started. For those Parties using the PRAIS 4 spatial data viewer to delineate the extents, an informative graphic can be used to interpret the percentage of the total area delineated that is degraded or improved per subindicator. This graphic chart should be used as a guide to understand what subindicator is driving the false positive or negative process being reported within the polygon extent provided."
