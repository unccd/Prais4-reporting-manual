msgid "Spatial resolution of international data might not always be suitable to produce a sufficiently detailed representation of the population exposed to land degradation and its changes. More detailed sub-national data might be needed to represent local situations with a higher degree of accuracy. However, this will require downscaling of existing gridded population datasets to a finer resolution which might incur further errors. Capacity in performing downscaling processes is therefore required."

msgid "The WorldPop sex-disaggregated national datasets are presented as several individual rasters, each representing an age/sex class per year. This amounts to a large volume of spatial data in Geotiff format. Capacity in raster data processing and access to appropriate computing power, e.g., a cloud service, is required to store and process the data, especially for large countries. The UNCCD is developing a procedure for the bulk preprocessing of raster data, which will eventually make sex-disaggregated data available on the PRAIS 4 platform as default data. Parties will be notified when the challenge is solved and the forms pre-filled with the default data."

In addition, further disaggregation of data in urban and rural populations could be useful to improve the indicator."
