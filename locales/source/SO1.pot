Accordingly, a mapping exercise should be undertaken to customize the land cover legend such that it will include only the minimum number of classes needed to capture and monitor land degradation processes reported on in Step 1. To illustrate, during the 2022 reporting cycle, some Parties implemented country-specific adaptations to the land cover legends. See Box 1 to read more on these legend adaptation examples."

In these cases, increasing the number of land cover classes or subdividing the country into regions for tailored analysis is essential. For example, during Colombia’s 2022 reporting process, experts highlighted glacier retreat and snow cover reduction as key degradation processes. To monitor such changes effectively, the standard seven UNCCD land cover classes were insufficient. After careful analysis of national land cover maps, experts determined that a minimum of 12 land cover classes was necessary, including the addition of Permanent Snow and Glaciers."

However, these 36 land cover classes can be re-classified differently to capture key land degradation processes at the national level. For example, Bhutan utilized the default land cover dataset but applied their own reclassification approaches to ensure that shrublands were explicitly represented. In Bhutan, woody encroachment was identified as a significant degradation process, necessitating the differentiation of shrublands from forests. After evaluating various reclassification options, experts adopted a seven-class legend that included shrublands while merging wetlands with water bodies, as Bhutan wetlands were not well mapped in the ESA-CCI dataset."

Countries are strongly encouraged to build the legend with a limited number of relevant classes and not to exceed 15 land cover classes in total.  This will make reporting more manageable, reduce the risk of performance issues on the web browser and would reduce the transitions to be described and reported in Step 3.

However, it is equally crucial to detect and model SOC changes in areas where land cover remains stable. Tier 3 methods, such as calibrated and validated ecosystem (process-based) modeling, offer a more comprehensive solution. These methods link models with country-specific spatial datasets, such as soil maps, land use, climate, and agricultural activity, providing a higher level of accuracy for estimating changes in SOC stocks. These approaches deliver more precise insights into SOC dynamics and therefore can improve the estimations of SDG indicator 15.3.1.

The extent of degradation in the reporting periods is calculated by summing (i) areas of land where changes in the sub-indicators are considered to indicate new degradation; and (ii) areas of land that have persisted in a degraded state since the baseline period (i.e. have not improved to a non-degraded state)."

Where countries are confident in reporting the location and extent of these processes and in recalculating the 1OAO process for SDG indicator 15.3.1 with the identified areas accounted for, they should use the PRAIS 4 spatial data viewer to do so (table SO1-4.T3)."
