msgid "Licensing of national datasets aims to empower country Parties reporting through PRAIS to set the terms of use of their national data uploaded or created as part of the reporting process by creating a User-Specific Licence (USL). The default licence for PRAIS data can be seen in the “Terms of Use” section of the site. Parties uploading national datasets to the system have the option to edit the default licence in the Spatial Layers list by clicking on the form provided per uploaded layer. However, while Parties are free to set their terms of use for their national datasets, the default data provided to Parties through PRAIS and Trends.Earth is already in the public domain as described [here](https://trends.earth/docs/en/about/data_sources.html), and therefore cannot be licensed separately by Parties. For example, the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover and the International Soil Reference and Information Centre Soil Grids data has been released under an “Attribution-Share Alike” licence. Thus, the use of these datasets is subject to the terms of this licence."

The Data may be provided to other PRAIS users on the understanding that they read it and consent to be bound by the terms and conditions of use set out in the USL (if the data is not already in the public domain)."
