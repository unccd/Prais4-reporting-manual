In short, SA-licensed work is able to be remixed, but only into other SA outputs."

msgid "However, licences with the SA constraint are NOT recommended as it makes reuse of the national report more complicated due to the need for licence stacking - combining multiple licenses with different and sometimes conflicting use conditions.

The Data will be used in regional and global aggregate maps, statistics and other information products by the secretariat, in fulfilling its mandate under Decision 11/COP.14, and may be provided to partners of the UNCCD on request and on the understanding that they read and consent to be bound by the terms and conditions of use set out in the USL (if the data is not already in the public domain or its source licence applies additional restriction on use of the data)."
