msgid "The implementation framework describes the approach adopted to support and implement the strategic objectives and furthermore provides Parties with an opportunity to share their knowledge and experiences. Although voluntary, this is a vital part of reporting as it helps to contextualise the quantitative information provided for each SO and indicator and it also provides additional narrative information about the actions on the ground that are being implemented by the Parties. Where relevant, Parties should report concrete cases of effective interventions, measurable improvements, tangible impacts and success stories demonstrating practical implementation at national and local level since the adoption of the strategic framework. Stories shared here can help to motivate other Parties and build understanding of successes and challenges in implementing the Convention. The main objectives of this part of reporting are to:"

These examples are presented in the publication [The Land Story](https://www.unccd.int/resources/publications/land-story-country-experiences-reporting-land-degradation-and-drought) (UNCCD, 2024). Material contributed to the implementation framework in this reporting cycle can provide additional examples and case studies for a future edition of a similar publication.

At the same time, policies should take into account the resourcefulness demonstrated by these population groups on some occasions in drought adaptation and mitigation, and give due recognition and encouragement of this resourcefulness. In order for any country to successfully address and manage DLDD, actions must be taken to fully engage the entirety of the population, and leverage their various perspectives, experiences and abilities. Further information on these issues, with several country-based examples, can be found in the recent UNCCD publication \"[Differentiated impacts of desertification, land degradation and drought on women and men](https://www.unccd.int/resources/brief/study-differentiated-impacts-dldd-women-and-men-summary-decision-makers)\" and \"[Women-led solutions for drought resilience](https://www.unccd.int/resources/publications/women-led-solutions-drought-resilience)”."
