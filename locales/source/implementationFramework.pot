As a result, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans and the Convention on Biological Diversity National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans may contribute to meeting targets under one or more of the Rio convention mechanisms mentioned as well as under the UNCCD, NAPs and/or LDN targets. Land-based interventions can help integrate and accelerate progress against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), many of which compete for limited land resources. Implementation measures may include the adoption of conservation measures, sustainable land management (SLM) practices and/or ecological rehabilitation/restoration of past land degradation, and may be pursued in ecosystem-based approaches such as ecosystem-based adaptation, ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and any other nature-based solution that involves land.
