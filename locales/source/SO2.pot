The international poverty line is currently set at USD 2.15 a day, based on 2017 purchasing power parity. Therefore, the proportion of the population below the international poverty line is defined as the percentage of the population living on less than USD 2.15 a day at 2017 international prices."

msgid "On the other hand, income inequality is a useful alternative to the poverty metric for those countries where poverty is no longer an issue, as it estimates the extent of wealth distribution in a region. It is estimated through the Gini index. The Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality."

For the default data, the grid cell size for the analysis is fixed at the 250 metre resolution of the land degradation dataset to which the population data is resampled. Countries using alternative global or national datasets should assess them in terms of geographical projection and spatial resolution and standardize them through a resampling process in order to combine them in the analysis of population exposure to land degradation."
