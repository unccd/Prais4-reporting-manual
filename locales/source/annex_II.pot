msgid "Metadata is information about data, the primary instrument to provide data users with a comprehensive description of the data, including its accuracy and quality, and provides key information to appropriately use data for decision-making. Without metadata, the user is extremely limited in interpreting and understanding the data."

#: ../../annex_II.md:9
msgid "Therefore, the availability of metadata increases the data’s value because it provides information on the data’s origin, its reliability and trustworthiness. Metadata is an inseparable component that makes data usable in Geographic Information System applications and other geospatial contexts. For several data exchange platforms, metadata provides the required information and structure for discovering and accessing data for different types of uses. In this context, the compliancy of metadata information with well-known standards is important in order to implement methods and tools enabling semantic searches and ensuring interoperability between systems. Accordingly, the PRAIS 4 platform metadata aims to maintain compatibility with one of the most used international metadata standards (ISO 19115, developed by the Technical Committee ISO/TC 211, Geographic information/Geomatics), which is specifically designed to describe geospatial data."
