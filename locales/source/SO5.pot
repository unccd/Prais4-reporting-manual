msgid "The SO5 indicator framework builds on the previous 2022 UNCCD reporting process, and it has been revised taking into account the guidance given through UNCCD CRIC recommendations and COP decisions (Decision 11/COP14, Decision 11/COP15 and Decision 12/ COP16) and the feedback of users of the PRAIS4 system. The revised SO5 reporting framework considers the current reporting experiences under the other Rio conventions, including the UNFCCC Enhanced Transparency Framework and the latest developments under the monitoring framework for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework of the CBD, with the aim of increasing synergies in data collection and reporting."
