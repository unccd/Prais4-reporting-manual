For example in one microbasin in the east of the country 34% of the croplands showed declining land productivity trends, indicating ongoing degradation processes. To counterbalance anticipated losses of natural capital, different cropland parcels were prioritized within the micro basin to implement SLM practices to reverse, reduce and avoid land degradation.

msgid "Trends.Earth can be used to run these calculations on the affected area defined. When calculating the indicators in Trends.Earth, Parties should upload the geospatial data of the affected area produced in Step 2 and use it as the area of analysis. Parties should refer to the Trends.Earth documentation for further information on how to use their own area file in the calculations. Once the indicators have been calculated in Trends.Earth and are ready for packaging for upload to PRAIS, Parties should ensure that the checkbox indicating the results are for Affected Areas only is ticked in Trends.Earth. This will ensure that when the results are uploaded to the PRAIS platform the results will automatically populate the Affected Area forms. However, any uploaded geospatial information for affected areas will overwrite any existing national data in PRAIS. Parties may also manually fill in the affected area forms with the required information."
