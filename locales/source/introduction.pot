msgid "The implementation framework (IF) defines the roles and responsibilities of Parties and Convention institutions in meeting the SOs. Based on a comprehensive review of the IF reporting forms after the 2022 reporting process, it will not be presented as a stand-alone section in the 2026 national reporting cycle. Instead, its elements will be integrated into the appropriate sections under each Strategic Objective (SO). Internal consultations within the secretariat further identified potential overlaps between questions in the framework and the data required under individual SOs. Consequently, the three core components of the framework — Policy and Planning, Actions on the Ground, and Financial and Non-Financial Resources — have been reviewed and restructured to align with the most relevant SOs. Additionally, information on vulnerable and marginalized groups can be captured, where relevant, via reporting on  the involvement of women, engagement of youth, and Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Parties can now find the respective section of the IF listed as an additional form under each SO with the form denoted with its respective SO number and ‘IF’ for Implementation Framework, e.g. the Implementation Framework form for SO1 is entitled ‘SO1-IF’."

msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.md:29
msgid "Information reported by Parties under the Convention is used in several ways. It is employed to monitor progress towards achieving SDG target 15.3 and to help guide policy formulation at the national and international level to combat desertification/land degradation and drought (DLDD). The information helps policymakers to better understand the geographical areas that are most affected in their countries and allows more targeted measures and interventions to be designed and implemented. A number of countries have leveraged the data and information provided in the latest round of reporting (2022) to produce national action plans to address land degradation or used some of the material as part of project proposals to seek national and international funding to implement concrete actions on the ground. Comprehensive reports by Parties provide practical demonstrations of how to optimise the reporting and implement on the ground interventions while motivating other Parties and build understanding of successes and challenges in implementing the Convention. Finally, the reported information plays an important role in raising awareness of the importance of sustainable land management and advocating for land restoration initiatives that can help combat DLDD and their impacts on populations. In a nutshell, national reporting puts data and information on land to good use."

While some indicators are marked as not applicable for developed country Parties, each developed country Party may choose whether to report on them or not. If a developed country Party decides to report on an indicator marked as not applicable, it can do so by changing the indicator form’s status from 'not applicable' to 'open' in PRAIS."

#: ../../introduction.md:413
msgid "E) Flexibility – the platform should clearly outline the differentiated reporting obligations of Affected Country Parties and Developed Country Parties, while allowing countries the flexibility to adjust the indicators they report—for example, by choosing to report on optional indicators or on indicators generally considered not applicable to their country category."

msgid "Once a reporting form has been completed and all the tables in that form have been filled in, the Reporting Officer can make the form  available to the secretariat for review. This will lock the form so that no further editing can take place and allow the review process to begin. The review is carried out by the UNCCD secretariat, and is necessary to ensure that reported figures are consistent and that the  reporting methodology is applied correctly. To make a form available for review, its status in the platform must be set to “In Review”. If during the review process the need for clarifications or amendments arises, the reviewers can insert feedback via comments and send back the form to the national reporting officer. The national reporting officer is notified when the review process is completed and if comments need to be addressed. The form will then be again set to “Open” mode and the reporting officer can address the comments and modify the report accordingly and resubmit it for another review cycle. When no further clarifications or amendments are required, the form is considered finalized and ready for the final submission to the secretariat."

Errors (arising from the application of system validation rules) appear on the forms to highlight any major discrepancies in reported data (see inter-tabular consistency paragraph below).

The system automatically prefills the total country, land and water body areas and national population in the country profile based on default data. If any reported degraded area, area under drought or populations exposed exceed the values reported in the country profile an error will appear since the percentage value reported cannot normally exceed 100%."
