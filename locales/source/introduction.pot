msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.md:23
msgid "Up-to-date information on measures taken, results achieved and challenges faced by country Parties is of critical importance for the COP to be able to adopt targeted decisions and guidance aimed at supporting the effective achievement of the SOs. The information communicated by Parties through reporting is valuable also for other stakeholders that work on the implementation of the UNCCD at national and local levels. From these viewpoints, national reporting is an indispensable tool to bringing forward effective planning and implementation of the Convention and the achievement of the SOs at global and national level."

In addition to the indicators adopted by the COP, five newly proposed indicators (i.e. SO 2-3, SO 4-3, SO 5-3, SO 5-4 and SO 5-5) will be tested during the 2022 reporting process. All newly proposed indicators will be considered optional in reporting until the COP takes a decision on whether to formally adopt them. Integrating them in the forthcoming reporting process will enable Parties to assess the suitability of the indicators for measuring progress towards the SOs and take an informed decision at the twentieth session of the CRIC held in conjunction with the COP. Table 1 through table 5 below contain an overview of the indicators, their related metrics/proxies and their statuses (i.e. whether the indicator is officially adopted, and if so, when it was adopted; or whether it is newly proposed and will be tested in the forthcoming reporting process). The tables also provide information on the reporting attributions."

UN Map Data includes geospatial web services, which aim to provide a contextual global webservices background to the international community. The current flagship United Nations geospatial service is entitled Clear Map[^3] (hereinafter referred to as UN Clear Map). UN Clear Map was originally designed and created for the use of the United Nations Secretariat and system for their website and related web products, but is now a publicly available resource subject to the terms of use. The UN Clear Map service is available in PRAIS 4 in different cartographic styles and web canvases to give countries context for the geospatial reporting data. However, the UN Clear Map has scale constraints, as it cannot be used beyond a map scale of 1:4.5 million. As the PRAIS 4 map view is fixed to the extent of the country boundaries, countries which are fixed at scales finer than this will not be able to use UN Clear Map.
