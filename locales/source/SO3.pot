The UNCCD methodology to estimate indicator SO 3-1 recommends using a globally accepted drought index, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), to characterize the meteorological drought hazard. However, Parties may report using other indices if already in use at national level. For example, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) may represent an alternative index, readily comparable to the SPI, that provides more reliable signals of drought in arid areas. Parties using the SPEI can apply the same methods recommended in this manual and in the “Good Practice Guidance for National Reporting on UNCCD Strategic Objective 3” to report indicator SO 3-1. For other indices currently in use, Parties may need to ensure statistical consistency with the SPI drought intensity classes described in table 19[^2]."
