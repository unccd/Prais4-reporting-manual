This ensures data are comparable between years as well as across both time and space. In order to normalize the 12-month precipitation accumulation data distributions, the WMO climatological standard normal period of 1981–2010 is used as a reference period. The normalization method is based on a Gamma probability distribution function fitted to the 12-month precipitation accumulations in this reference period. Once calculated, these probability distribution parameters are then applied to any time series of monthly 12-month precipitation accumulations to produce the normalized monthly SPI-12 time series for each grid cell for the entire period for which data is available. However, if Parties choose to change the standard climate normal (reference) period this then necessitates a recalculation of the SPI for all periods.
