"Licensing of national datasets aims to empower country Parties reporting "
"through PRAIS to set the terms of use of their national data uploaded or "
"created as part of the reporting process by creating a User-Specific "
"Licence (USL). The default licence for PRAIS data can be seen in the "
"“Terms of Use” section of the site. Parties uploading national datasets "
"to the system have the option to edit the default licence in the Spatial "
"Layers list by clicking on the form provided per uploaded layer. However,"
" while Parties are free to set their terms of use for their national "
"datasets, the default data provided to Parties through PRAIS and "
"Trends.Earth is already in the public domain as described "
"[here](https://trends.earth/docs/en/about/data_sources.html), and "
"therefore cannot be licensed separately by Parties. For example, the "
"European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover and the "
"International Soil Reference and Information Centre Soil Grids data has "
"been released under an “Attribution-Share Alike” licence. Thus, the use "
"of these datasets is subject to the terms of this licence."
