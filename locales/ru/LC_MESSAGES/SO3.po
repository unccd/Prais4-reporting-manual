However, Parties may report using other indices if already in use at national level. For example, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) may represent an alternative index, readily comparable to the SPI, that provides more reliable signals of drought in arid areas. Parties using the SPEI can apply the same methods recommended in this manual and in the “Good Practice Guidance for National Reporting on UNCCD Strategic Objective 3” to report indicator SO 3-1.
