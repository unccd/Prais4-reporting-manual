# 7. Implementation framework: policy and planning, actions on the ground and financial and non-financial resources

## 7.1. About the implementation framework

### 7.1.1. Introduction

The implementation framework describes the approach adopted to support and implement the strategic objectives and furthermore provides Parties with an opportunity to share their knowledge and experiences. Although voluntary, this is a vital part of reporting as it helps to contextualise the quantitative information provided for each SO and indicator and it also provides additional narrative information about the actions on the ground that are being implemented by the Parties.  Where relevant, Parties should report concrete cases of effective interventions, measurable improvements, tangible impacts and success stories demonstrating practical implementation at national and local level since the adoption of the strategic framework. Stories shared here can help to motivate other Parties and build understanding of successes and challenges in implementing the Convention. The main objectives of this part of reporting are to:

- Understand how policies and plans are being implemented to reach the goals of the Convention;

- Identify practical actions on the ground that illustrate how the Convention can be successfully implemented;

- Highlight how financial resources from different sources are mobilised to fund implementation of the actions.

For the 2026 reporting process, the relevant part of the implementation framework is placed separately under each SO. For SO1- SO4 these sections focus on two broad areas:


**(a) Policy and planning**

Sharing experiences in: 
(i) the development, implementation and monitoring of national, subregional and regional action programmes and/or plans for UNCCD implementation; 
(ii) the establishment of policies and enabling environments; 
(iii) mainstreaming of efforts to combat desertification/land degradation and drought (DLDD);
(iv) improvements in drought preparedness and management.
(v) leveraging of synergies with other Conventions and goals.


**(b) Actions on the ground**

Sharing experience in: 
(i) successful implementation practices used to achieve sustainable land management;
(ii) establishing knowledge sharing systems; 
(iii) drought risk management and early warning systems;
(iv) alternative livelihoods.


**(c) Financial and non-financial resources**

Sharing experiences in: 
(i) the development, implementation and monitoring of national strategies for mobilizing resources for UNCCD implementation; 
(ii) leveraging of synergies with other Conventions and goals, especially in relation to mobilizing resources;
(iii) national circumstances and institutional arrangements relevant to the reporting process on Strategic Objective 5 and the progress indicators.


### 7.1.2. Approach to reporting and structure of the reporting template

Reporting on the implementation framework is generally in a tabular and narrative format, and is voluntary.

A specific reporting template (SOx-IF) can be found as the final element for each of the SOs in  the PRAIS 4 platform and includes one or more of the applicable sections.

The template poses a series of high-level questions to which the Parties can answer “Yes/No”. If the answer is “Yes”, then the Parties have the opportunity to provide additional information on each topic detailing the country´s experience. This additional information can be provided by filling in the tables, containing a combination of selections from drop-down menus and free descriptive text.

Additionally, comment boxes are included at the end of each form where other relevant information which is not easily or fully described in the tables or through answers to the specific questions can be added. The narrative nature of the implementation framework section gives Parties an opportunity to provide and share information on experiences and challenges. Parties are also encouraged to add one or more examples in support of the stated experiences, including the approach/procedure that was used, how the reported examples were successful, and what factors contributed to their success.

### 7.1.3. Reporting for Action

The information provided through reporting on the implementation framework will be used, inter alia, for the official sessions of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention to highlight experiences gained in the implementation of the Convention.  For example, the information from the 2022 reporting cycle was used to compile examples of interventions made by countries to halt and reverse land degradation. These examples are presented in the publication The Land Story (UNCCD, 2024). Material contributed to the implementation framework in this reporting cycle can provide additional examples and case studies for a future edition of a similar publication. Such case studies can serve as an inspiration to all countries and provide practical ideas on how they can address land degradation in their own countries.

The following sections in this reporting manual provide advice on the specific content and type of information that is required in the tables and narratives concerning each area/aim within the Implementation Framework part of the reporting.

## 7.2. Policy and planning

Parties are encouraged to answer questions related to the following five main topics. Not all SOs address all of these topics. 

### 7.2.1. Action plans and programmes

```{note}
Relevant to SO1
```

This relates to the development, implementation, revision and monitoring of national, subregional and regional action programmes and/or plans as effective tools for UNCCD implementation, such as the national action programmes (NAPs). NAPs are developed through participatory approaches involving various stakeholders at national, subregional and regional levels, and they encompass practical steps and measures that contribute to combating land degradation/desertification and mitigating the effects of drought.

The reporting template encourages Parties to list and describe the most important action programmes related to desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD). Parties should be as comprehensive as possible in describing the action plan or programme, identifying the status of the action, any successes achieved and the challenges that are being addressed in its implementation. Parties should also specify whether the plan was developed using a participatory process and, if so, whether women, youth, indigenous people and local communities and their representatives were involved in planning and decision-making.

### 7.2.2. Policies and enabling environment

```{note}
Relevant to SO1, SO2, SO3
```

This section focuses on identifying policies, legislative measures, funding mechanisms and other organizational processes that have been established to ensure an enabling environment for promoting and implementing solutions to:

1.	combat desertification/land degradation (SO1);
2.	address inclusion of underrepresented groups in the implementation of the Convention (SO2) and 
3.	combat drought and promote drought resilience (SO3).

The reporting template encourages Parties to list and describe the most important enabling activities related to the SO. Parties should be as comprehensive as possible in describing these, identifying the status of the activity, any successes achieved and the challenges that are being addressed in its implementation.

For SO1 and SO3 there are questions about the support provided to other Parties for implementing the Convention. Details on the type of support provided can be presented. These questions are addressed in principle to Parties to the Convention which may not suffer from DLDD, but which support those that do. However, they may also address Parties that engage in South–South cooperation as part of the implementation of this Convention.

For SO2 it is important to report on how women, youth, Indigenous people and local communities have been fully engaged in all policy processes, as they are too often excluded or their involvement is minimized, while they are also among the most vulnerable to the harsh impacts of DLDD. At the same time, policies should take into account the resourcefulness demonstrated by these population groups on some occasions in drought adaptation and mitigation, and give due recognition and encouragement of this resourcefulness.  In order for any country to successfully address and manage DLDD, actions must be taken to fully engage the entirety of the population, and leverage their various perspectives, experiences and abilities. Further information on these issues, with several country-based examples, can be found in the recent UNCCD publication "Differentiated impacts of desertification, land degradation and drought on women and men" and "Women-led solutions for drought resilience”.

### 7.2.3. Mainstreaming efforts to combat desertification/land degradation and drought

```{note}
Relevant to SO1, SO3
```

Parties are encouraged to report on their approach to mainstreaming DLDD in a range of policy areas with a view to increasing the impact and effectiveness of the implementation of the Convention. These policy areas cover (i) economic, (ii) environmental, (iii) social, (iv) land, (v) gender and (VI) agricultural policies. Parties may choose to address issues related to income generation/poverty reduction, gender equality, unemployment, migration, disaster preparedness, energy efficiency or wildlife conservation, among others.

Parties may include the rationale behind the mainstreaming of DLDD in policies, information on coverage/users of the policy, and details of the process for preparing and deciding on the methods for the mainstreaming. Where possible the impact and effectiveness of the actions should also be discussed, as well as the main success factors  and challenges encountered.

### 7.2.4 National drought plans

```{note}
Relevant to SO3
```

Parties are invited to identify any national drought plans. Should such a plan exist, Parties are encouraged to describe the processes used to develop it, indicate how successful it has been and comment on any challenges faced during its development or implementation. Parties should also specify whether the plan was developed using a participatory process and, if so, whether women, youth, indigenous people and local communities and their representatives were involved in planning and decision-making. A link to the national drought plan should be provided if available.

A file with further information may also be uploaded. This might include additional information, for example on the establishment of a multi-stakeholder coordination mechanism (body) on drought preparedness, establishment and maintenance of a drought monitoring and early warning system, drought vulnerability and impact assessments at various levels (sector wide, regional or national), and/or implementation of practical drought risk mitigation measures (such as water harvesting, crop insurance and/or irrigation practices). Additional information may also report on gender-responsive drought management, preparedness and resilience-building. In this regard, of special interest would be a description of the approach/procedure used to develop drought preparedness and/or contingency plans.

Parties may include information on the coverage (national/local) of the drought policy/measure and list the authorities and other main stakeholders involved in the implementation. They may also include the main aims and activities of the drought policy/measure, the actions taken and the results achieved so far, including the main success factors. 

### 7.2.5 Synergies

```{note}
Relevant to SO4
```

This refers to strategies and actions aimed at leveraging synergies in DLDD-related activities and integrating DLDD in planning and implementation to generate simultaneous benefits and added value for other multilateral environmental agreements or international commitments.

For example, DLDD processes can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, habitat loss and decline in biodiversity. However, the implementation of SLM to address DLDD may not only help achieve the goals of the UNCCD, but may also support achievement of the goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as well as relevant targets under all 17 SDGs, in particular SDG target 15.3.

Parties may indicate to which policy areas the synergies apply. These policy areas cover (i) economic, (ii) environmental, (iii) social, (iv) land, (v) gender and (VI) agricultural policies. Furthermore, Parties may provide information on relevant activities or plans (LDN targets, climate or biodiversity commitments or plans, SDGs, NAPs or similar) and include information on their linkages, including any synergies generated and the main success factors.

## 7.3. Action on the ground

This is a critical element of reporting within the implementation framework. Its aim is to demonstrate real-world impact, identify successful strategies, and enable the sharing of experience and lessons across countries.

### 7.3.1. Sustainable land management practices

```{note}
Relevant to SO1
```

This form allows Parties to report on their implementation of sustainable land management (SLM) practices, including rehabilitation, restoration and drought management practices. In particular, Parties can:

- Highlight proven practices (e.g., agroforestry, forest plantation management, erosion control, water harvesting, etc.) that effectively address DLDD;

- Record which vulnerable or marginalized groups (e.g., women, Indigenous peoples, youth) are participating in, benefiting from, or leading these efforts;

- Identify the major challenges (e.g. institutional, knowledge of SLM, legal framework, etc.) encountered in the implementation.

In addition to the table to be completed, Parties can expand on their experience through the Comments field of by uploading a file. Furthermore, Parties may provide links to documented good practices that have been uploaded to the UNCCD´s designated/accredited World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) database[^1] or another similar online database. Parties wishing to document new good practices are encouraged to do so using the WOCAT database

### 7.3.2. Establishing knowledge-sharing systems

```{note}
Relevant to SO1, SO3
```

Parties are encouraged to describe their experience in establishing systems for sharing information and knowledge and facilitating networking on good practices and approaches to DLDD, including rehabilitation and restoration and drought management. This has the goal of:

- Offering examples of scalable and replicable interventions that could benefit other countries or regions.

- Encouraging the use of platforms like WOCAT for documenting and disseminating good SLM practices.

Knowledge-sharing systems range from community-level farmers’ networks to national databanks and multi-country peer learning networks. They have a variety of functions, such as facilitating communication on SLM and alerts on drought, the sharing of experiences, information and technologies, institutional coordination, provision of scientific data and information, and promotion of the upscaling of good practices. The description to be included on the form or uploaded as a separate file may also include information on experiences in promoting women’s access to knowledge and technology.

Via the available reporting table, when available, a list of the international, regional, national or subnational information/knowledge-sharing systems and networks on DLDD in which the country participates should be included. If possible, a link to each system/network website should be added. The list, together with the links, will be made available on the UNCCD website at https://www.unccd.int/resources/knowledge-sharing-systems.

The table also allows Parties to provide a description of each experience, They are encouraged to include information on the purpose and coverage (area/population) of the information/knowledge system or network, its specific focus/topic if any, the language(s) the information is available in, and a brief description of the main activities. They may also explain how the system/network has been used/useful so far, and the main success factors and challenges encountered.

### 7.3.3. Alternative livelihoods

```{note}
Relevant to SO2
```

Parties are encouraged to describe their experience in promoting alternative livelihoods, so as to ensure subsistence and generate income using natural resources in a (new) manner that prevents or reduces land degradation while enhancing the resilience of communities in degraded areas. Among the experiences presented Parties may choose to:

- Highlight livelihood options that decrease reliance on unsustainable land-use practices (e.g., overgrazing, slash-and-burn agriculture);

- Describe activities that encourage a shift away from activities that exacerbate degradation toward rehabilitation and restoration;

- Show how alternative livelihoods diversify income sources, making communities less vulnerable to environmental and economic shocks;

- Demonstrate how alternative livelihoods contribute to long-term rural development and help break cycles of poverty and land degradation.

In the table to be completed, an overview of the action program or project should be provided, complemented by the category of the program or project and relevant examples. The reported experiences may address different categories of livelihood focused interventions (i.e., alternative livelihoods, compensation schemes, incentive schemes) and completed, ongoing or planned examples of these experiences should be provided in the table.

In the description, Parties may provide a brief description of the area/people that were involved, the aim of the activities, action that was taken, role of women, youth, indigenous people and local communities, and measures taken to ensure their participation in the activities. The narrative should also describe the outcomes of the activities and the main success factors and challenges encountered. Experiences from the LDN Target-Setting Programme should be reported, when applicable.

Parties are also invited to report on the actions being taken to reduce migration forced by desertification and land degradation.

In addition to the table Parties can expand on their experience through the Comments field or by uploading an additional file.

### 7.3.4. Drought risk management and early warning systems

```{note}
Relevant to SO3
```

Parties are encouraged to describe their experience in developing and operationalizing drought risk management, monitoring, and early warning systems and safety net programmes. Reporting can help to:

- Strengthen preparedness and resilience by highlighting measures that help communities and ecosystems anticipate, respond to, and recover from drought impacts;

- Demonstrate progress in early warning capabilities, including monitoring, forecasting, and information dissemination systems that reduce vulnerability and enable timely action;

- Support integrated drought risk reduction strategies by linking early warning systems to policy, planning, and local-level implementation.

In addition to the table to be completed, Parties can expand on their experience through the Comments field or by uploading an additional file. Such experiences may include, for example, capacity-building and extension services, implemented national strategies that cover drought risk management, and ways to monitor the early warning systems.

In the description, Parties may include information on the type of activities, people involved, aim of the activities, and action taken. In reporting on capacity-building, extension services and other activities, if possible indicate the numbers or percentage of participants who were women, youth, indigenous people and/or local community members. The narrative should also describe the outcomes of the activities and the main success factors.

Parties are also asked to indicate how the UNCCD Community of Learning and Practice on Drought Management has supported the efforts in developing drought risk management plans and early warning systems. 

Furthermore, Parties may describe any support provided to another country to develop and operationalize drought risk management, monitoring and early warning systems and safety net programmes. In the description, it is recommended to include information on the type of practice, main activities, main stakeholders involved, duration, and resources used. The reasons for the successful implementation of this practice, how it has avoided or reduced land degradation in the long term, and the main success factors should also be reported.

## 7.4. Financial and non-financial resources

Parties are encouraged to answer questions related to the following three main topics

### 7.4.1. Resource mobilization strategy

```{note}
Relevant to SO5
```

Reporting on resource mobilization helps to:

- Identify and highlight financial needs, sources, and gaps for implementing UNCCD activities and achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) targets;

- Track progress in mobilising resources from domestic, international, and private sources to support sustainable land management;

- Highlight partnerships and mechanisms used to leverage funding, such as blended finance or public-private partnerships.

To this end, Parties are therefore encouraged to indicate whether they have a national strategy for mobilizing resources for the implementation of the Convention in place, or at least, whether they are in the process of devising such a national resource mobilization strategy. If so, country Parties are requested to provide further details, as a minimum, in relation to the issues stated above and any relevant weblinks.

If no such strategy is in place or is under development, then country Parties should provide information regarding any other current or planned measures to enable the mobilization of resources for DLDD.

### 7.4.2. Synergies

```{note}
Relevant to SO5
```

This refers to strategies and actions aimed at leveraging synergies in DLDD-related activities and integrating DLDD in planning and implementation to generate simultaneous benefits and added value for other multilateral environmental agreements or international commitments. In relation to SO5 Parties can provide information on synergies in the mobilization of financial and non-financial resources for the three Rio Conventions. If such synergies exist, Parties are asked to describe their experience, including challenges and opportunities. Parties could also indicate and provide details if relevant on whether they plan to mobilize resources jointly for the three Rio Conventions in the future.


### 7.4.3. Reporting process

Information on the reporting process for SO-5 helps to ensure understanding, clarity and transparency, in relation to implementing the Convention.  It allows Parties to share how they organise, coordinate and validate their national reporting process as well as reflect on lessons learned and challenges.

Therefore, Parties are asked to offer information on national circumstances and institutional arrangements relevant to the reporting process on Strategic Objective 5 and its progress indicators. To this effect, a table for reporting qualitative information is provided.  Details on the national entities involved in the reporting process can be provided using both the drop-down menus and the narrative fields. In particular the role of the entities involved should be described as comprehensively as possible.

*Finally, country Parties can offer any other concluding general comments on the reporting process in the General Comments field.*
