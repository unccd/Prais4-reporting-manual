# Annex II: Metadata

Parties may decide not to use the default data provided when reporting on any of the SO indicators. When Parties use alternative datasets, a minimum set of metadata, to identify the data source must be entered by completing the pop-up form associated with these new data sources. Four fields have to be completed using free text:

**Title**: The text label used to uniquely identify the dataset

**Source Link/Identifier**: this can be a hyperlink to the dataset itself or a unique identifier of the dataset. If a DOI exists it can be inserted here.

**Author/Publisher**: the person(s) or institution which publishes the dataset

**Bibliographical Citation**: This should be a full and comprehensive citation of the dataset , including if possible, the dataset authors, the year of publication, the full title of the dataset or a related publication, the publication in which the dataset is cited (e.g. journal, report, book) and the place of publication.

The metadata form only appears in reporting forms where quantitative data are being reported, when the user switches from ‘Default’ to ‘National’ data and clicks on the ‘Edit Default Data’ button. There is one metadata form for each relevant indicator form.
